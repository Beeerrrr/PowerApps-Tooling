# Changes to YAML file format generated by PASopa

The Power Apps Source Packager (PASopa) generates a YAML file format decribed in [YAMLFileFormat.md](YAMLFileFormat.md). This document outlines changes to the format that have been made to improve readability and source control experience. 

## Removed "As" operator
"As" operator is replaced with a separate line `Control: Button` for example. This is to make the format more readable and to avoid the need to escape the colon in the name of the control.

## Added ordering of controls
Controls are ordered in the order they appear in the source file.

## Removed ZIndex
ZIndex is removed from the format to reduce noise in the source files. ZIndex is not a common property that is modified by the app maker and is not needed in the source files.
